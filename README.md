        * More info available [here](https://github.com/volkamerlab/covid19-SBapproach/tree/master/notebooks/focused_library_similar_proteins)
    * Compound preprocessing and filtering
        * Generate 3D conformations
        * Filter by similarity to fragments
        * [TODO] Select divers subset
        * [TODO] others
    * Docking
       * Dock selected compounds to target ensemble using smina
       * See [Pipeline](https://github.com/volkamerlab/covid19-SBapproach/tree/master/notebooks/Docking).
    * [TODO] Growing
      * SeeSAR for DiamondX fragment growing
    * [TODO] Explore available compounds in REAL space (Availability by Enamine)
        * InfiniSee search using FTrees in REALspace
    * [Skip for now] MD simulations to verify docking results
        * or use [covid moonshot pipeline](https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/covid-moonshot)

### Proposed pipelines (one per submission)
<!-- AV: Clear when done. -->

1. [Trial case to set up pipeline]: Known protease inhibitors
    * Screening data: Protease inhibitors
        * Fragment MCS: only use compounds which contain at least (a decent part of) one fragment
            * Non-covalent fragments used
        * Preprocess molceules
            * Generate 3D
    * Perform docking
        * Ensemble method
        * Select most promising compounds
    * [TODO] Search for most similar compounds in Enamine REAL space
        * Using InfiniSee Software
        * Postprocessing (here or later):
            * Select diverse subset
            * Cross-check with postera submissions
            * Selection of ~20 candidates
    * [TODO] Reevaluate proposed hits
        * Docking
    * [TODO] Submission
2. [TODO] Docking Approach: Start from focused ChEMBL library
    * Screening data: Protease inhibitors
        * Fragment MCS: only use compounds which contain at least (a decent part of) one fragment

        * Preprocess molceules
            * Generate 3D
    * Perform docking
