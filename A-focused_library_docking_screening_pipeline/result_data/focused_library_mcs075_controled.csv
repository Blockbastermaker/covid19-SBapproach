A range of concentrations of the potential inhibitor was used to generate data for calculating the concentration of inhibitor resulting in 50% of the effect (e.g. IC50, the concentration of the competitor inhibiting PDE10A activity by 50%). Non-specific activity was tested without the enzyme. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate solution (cGMP and [3H]-cGMP) and allowed to progress for 20 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 25 uA of YSi-SPA scintillation beads (GE Healthcare, cat. # RPNQ0150) in 18 mM zinc sulphate solution (stop reagent). After 1 h under shaking, the plate was centrifuged one minute at 170 g to allow beads to settle.
