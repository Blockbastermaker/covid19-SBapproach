A range of concentrations of the potential inhibitor was used to generate data for calculating the concentration of inhibitor resulting in 50% of the effect (e.g. IC50, the concentration of the competitor inhibiting PDE10A activity by 50%). Non-specific activity was tested without the enzyme. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate solution (cGMP and [3H]-cGMP) and allowed to progress for 20 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 25 ¿l of YSi-SPA scintillation beads (GE Healthcare, cat. # RPNQ0150) in 18 mM zinc sulphate solution (stop reagent).

477;17732277;CHEMBL3887823;Inhibition Assay: The human PDE10A full length assay was performed in 96-well micro titer plates. The reaction mixture of 50 ul contained 20 mM HEPES pH=7.5/10 mM MgCl2/0.05 mg/ml BSA (Sigma cat. # A-7906), 50 nM cGMP (Sigma, cat. # G6129) and 50 nM [3H]-cGMP (GE Healthcare, cat. # TRK392 S.A. 13.2 Ci/mmol), 3.75 ng/well PDE10A enzyme (Enzo Life Science, Lausen, Switzerland cat # SE-534) with or without a specific test compound. A range of concentrations of the potential inhibitor was used to generate data for calculating the concentration of inhibitor resulting in 50% of the effect (e.g. IC50, the concentration of the competitor inhibiting PDE10A activity by 50%). Non-specific activity was tested without the enzyme. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate solution (cGMP and [3H]-cGMP) and allowed to progress for 20 minutes at room temperature.

The beads are allowed to settle for one hr in the dark before the plates are counted in a Wallac 1450 Microbeta counter.

The assay is performed in a 384-well format with 50 uL assay buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 7.5; 1.3 mM MgCl2; 0.01% Brij) containing enough PDE10.";B;CHEMBL3691404;=;CHEMBL4409;Homo sapiens;IC50;nM;0.275;9.560667306169737;CCOc1nc(C)nc2c1CN(c1ncnn3c(C)nc([C@@H]4CCOC4)c13)CC2;InChI=1S/C20H25N7O2/c1-4-29-20-15-9-26(7-5-16(15)23-12(2)24-20)19-18-17(14-6-8-28-10-14)25-13(3)27(18)22-11-21-19/h11,14H,4-10H2,1-3H3/t14-/m1/s1;KTGGZILBTWZLLO-CQSZACIVSA-N;Homo sapiens;Phosphodiesterase 10A;SINGLE PROTEIN;Q9Y233;Mpro-x1077;N#Cc1ccc(N2CCCOCC2)cn1;0.25;Mpro-x0995;Nc1cncnc1;0.8571428571428571

Pharmacol., vol. 60, pp. 1333-1341, 2000), by the radiolabeled nucleotide method.Specifically, the measurements of the inhibitory activities were carried out in the following method.(Method) The test compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). 2 uL of the compound solution was added to 96 well plate, and the reaction mixture (20 uL of PDE enzyme solution in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 uL of the assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.07% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.825 mg/mL bovine serum albumin), and 20 uL of 1 mg/mL snake venom in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0) was added to the 96 well plate. The enzyme reaction was started by adding and mixing with substrate solution of 20 L containing approximate 35 nM 3H-cAMP in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.
